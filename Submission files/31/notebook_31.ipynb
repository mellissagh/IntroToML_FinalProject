    "### Label Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The target variable `label` is nearly perfectly balanced between class 0 and class 1. This is ideal, as it removes the need for any resampling techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, or class-weight adjustments.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Distributions of Numeric Features\n",
    "\n",
    "We plotted histograms and kernel density estimates (KDE) for the main numeric features.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### loan_amount\n",
    "\n",
    "This feature is highly right-skewed with extreme outliers. Most loans are below 1,000, but a small number exceed 300,000. We considered a log transformation, but this negatively affected model performance. We therefore retained the original values.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### applicant_income\n",
    "\n",
    "Follows a similar pattern to loan_amount, with mostly low-to-medium values and a long right tail. Although log transformation was evaluated, the raw values yielded higher AUC and were kept.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### population\n",
    "\n",
    "Most census tracts in the dataset have populations between 1,000 and 10,000. A few tracts represent large urban areas. LightGBM was found to be robust to these outliers, so no filtering was applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### minority_population\n",
    "\n",
    "This feature is left-skewed. Many areas have low minority percentages, while a smaller subset has high concentrations. This may reflect geographic and socioeconomic segregation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### hud_median_family_income\n",
    "\n",
    "The distribution shows multiple peaks, likely indicating that the data spans diverse economic or geographic regions. The variable was retained without transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### tract_to_msamd_income\n",
    "\n",
    "As expected, this feature is centered around 100, indicating parity with the metropolitan statistical area median income. Some tracts are significantly wealthier or poorer than average.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Correlation Heatmap\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the numeric features have low correlation with the target variable `label` (all under 0.1), which suggests that no single feature is strongly predictive in isolation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notable correlations include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* loan_amount and applicant_income: approximately 0.45  \n",
    "* population and number_of_owner_occupied_units: approximately 0.87  \n",
    "\n",
    "These indicate some degree of feature redundancy. Tree-based models like RandomForrest are typically robust to this.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outlier Detection Summary\n",

    "\n",
    "We generated a pairplot using 1,000 randomly sampled rows and colored them by label. There is no clear linear separation between the classes. This supports the use of non-linear models such as gradient boosting.\n",

    "The agency feature is dominated by a single category, with a few other categories appearing less frequently. We applied one-hot encoding to preserve all available information. This approach performed better than grouping rare categories together.\n"

    "## Part 2: Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Are there any outliers in the data?  \n",
    "Yes. We detected outliers using the IQR method in columns like `loan_amount`, `applicant_income`, and `population`.  \n",
    "We chose not to remove them, since our models (especially LightGBM) handled them well. Removing them reduced performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Are the data normalized? If not, should they be? What is the importance of normalization here?  \n",
    "We tested normalization with `StandardScaler`. It helped with models like KNN and Logistic Regression, but not with tree-based models.  \n",
    "We removed normalization from the final pipeline because it reduced our overall AUC.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Are there missing values? How did you handle them and why?  \n",
    "Yes. We used mean imputation with `SimpleImputer`.  \n",
    "More complex methods like KNN imputation were tested but did not improve results and slowed training.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. How did you handle categorical variables?  \n",
    "We applied one-hot encoding using `pd.get_dummies()` after combining train and test sets.  \n",
    "This ensured aligned columns across both sets. Grouping rare categories slightly reduced performance, so we kept all of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Is the dimensionality too high? Why is that a problem, and how can it be detected?\n",
    "Yes. After encoding, the number of features became large.\n",
    "High dimensionality can cause overfitting, slow training, and reduce interpretability. We detected this by measuring the final feature count and comparing performance with smaller feature sets.\n",
    "Tree-based models like LightGBM handled the full feature set well. Training time increased (about 3 to 7 minutes), but there was **no sign of overfitting** based on validation AUC and cross-validation. So we decided to keep all features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Dimensionality reduction (PCA or feature selection): How did it affect the model?\n",
    "We tested PCA (keeping 95 percent variance) and also removed low-variance and redundant features.\n",
    "In both cases, AUC dropped by 1–2 percent, and PCA made feature importance impossible to interpret. Tree-based models like LightGBM performed worse with reduced input.\n",
    "Separately, we noticed that the `ID` column appeared as one of the most important features. To investigate this, we ran several experiments where we shuffled, dropped, or randomized the `ID` in train or test. This confirmed that the `ID` carried useful structural signal (likely tied to hidden ordering or leakage in the data). Because of this, we were extra careful about removing features, and eventually decided to keep the full feature set without dimensionality reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Did you construct new features or apply transformations?  \n",
    "Yes. We created features like `loan_to_income` and tried log transforms.  \n",
    "None improved the AUC, so we removed them from the final pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Was preprocessing applied to the test set as well?\n",
    "Yes. All preprocessing steps were applied to the test set in the exact same way as the training set.\n",
    "We **combined train and test sets before encoding** to ensure consistent one-hot columns.  \n",
    "We also used the **same fitted imputer and scaler** (from the training data) to transform the test data.  \n",
    "This ensured there was no data leakage and that all test features matched the training schema exactly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bonus: Additional Techniques Beyond Course Material\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond the required tasks, we developed and used tools and modeling strategies that were not covered in the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "To support experimentation at scale, we built a full testing environment that allowed us to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Automatically run dozens of models across different feature sets, scoring margins, and training configurations\n",
    "- Handle exceptions gracefully, allowing experiments to continue even if some models failed\n",
    "- Log AUC scores, hyperparameters, and notes into structured folders using `.pkl` files and CSV logs\n",
    "- Run experiments asynchronously over several hours, utilizing resources efficiently\n",
    "- Track and compare results over time to identify the best-performing setups\n",
    "\n",
    "This infrastructure allowed us to test over 50 configurations systematically. We iterated based on results, refined our preprocessing pipeline, and narrowed down the best-performing model for final submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also used external libraries not included in the course such as **LightGBM**, **XGBoost**, and **CatBoost**, which helped improve performance significantly. These frameworks offered faster training, better support for structured features, and more flexibility in hyperparameter tuning."

    "## Part 3 – Model Execution\n",
    "\n",
    "We implemented a range of models, both basic and advanced, in line with the project requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Models\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Logistic Regression**  \n",
    "  Served as our main linear baseline. Despite its simplicity, it performed surprisingly well with an AUC of approximately 0.909. We experimented with both L1 and L2 regularization. Reducing the regularization strength (e.g., `C=0.01`) slightly improved generalization. Logistic regression was stable and interpretable but limited in capturing non-linear relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  \n",
    "  Produced significantly lower results, peaking around 0.801 AUC. Even after tuning `n_neighbors` and using distance weighting, performance remained poor. The model is sensitive to high-dimensional feature spaces, and distance metrics degrade in such contexts. KNN is not well-suited for large structured datasets like this.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advanced Models\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Random Forest**  \n",
    "  Delivered solid results, reaching up to 0.940 AUC. Increasing the number of trees (`n_estimators=500`) and allowing deeper trees (`max_depth=19`) improved accuracy. Random Forest handles a variety of features well and is robust to overfitting, but was ultimately outperformed by boosting models.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **AdaBoost**  \n",
    "  Peaked at around 0.929 AUC. Boosting helped capture more complex interactions than bagging, though it was more sensitive to noise and required careful tuning of the learning rate and number of estimators.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  \n",
    "  Significantly underperformed, with a maximum AUC below 0.90. We tested both linear and RBF kernels, and even after downsampling the data to fit memory constraints, the training time was long and the accuracy didn’t justify the cost. SVM does not scale well to large tabular datasets with many features.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing the required models, we continued testing the remaining advanced models from the course syllabus, including **Random Forest** and **AdaBoost**. These ensemble methods gave strong results, with Random Forest in particular outperforming the earlier models and reaching up to 0.94 AUC.\n",
    "\n",
    "To further improve performance, we went beyond the course scope and explored gradient boosting frameworks such as **XGBoost**, **LightGBM**, and **CatBoost**. These models are known to perform exceptionally well on structured/tabular datasets, offering more precise control over tree growth and regularization. They allowed us to push AUC even higher and refine our pipeline further.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Progression\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the low performance of KNN and SVM, we quickly pivoted to **Random Forest**, which yielded much better results. It consistently reached AUC scores between **0.93 and 0.94** with minimal tuning. This led us to research more advanced ensemble methods, and we discovered **gradient boosting**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we began testing XGBoost and LightGBM, the improvement was immediate and significant. It was surprising how much higher the AUC scores climbed — we reached what we considered \"crazy numbers\" by comparison to the earlier models.\n",
    "\n",
    "LightGBM ultimately became our final model, with a best AUC of **0.9809**. Its speed, flexibility, and performance on large, sparse datasets made it ideal for our use case. We validated it through cross-validation, and its results were consistently superior.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gradient Boosting and LightGBM\n",
    "\n",
    "**XGBoost**  \n",
    "Performed extremely well, achieving an AUC of 0.976. It captured complex interactions and proved robust to overfitting. It became our go-to model during early experimentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**LightGBM**  \n",
    "Became our final model of choice, with the highest AUC of **0.9809**. LightGBM trained significantly faster than XGBoost and handled categorical features efficiently. Its histogram-based splits and leaf-wise tree growth allowed for better accuracy with less compute time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**CatBoost**  \n",
    "Was also tested. It had strong performance but did not exceed LightGBM in AUC or speed, so we focused on LightGBM for final optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use of the ID Feature\n",
    "\n",
    "During development, we observed that the `ID` feature ranked very high in feature importance across tree-based models. Although it appeared to be a simple row index, it had a significant and consistent impact on performance.\n",

    "These results confirmed that `ID` encoded meaningful structure. After consulting with the course instructor and validating generalization, we received approval to include it in the final model. We documented all findings transparently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hyperparameter Tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "We tuned the following hyperparameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Logistic Regression**: `C`, `penalty`, `solver`, `max_iter`\n",
    "- **KNN**: `n_neighbors`, `weights`, `metric`\n",

    "| **Random Forest**       | 0.9407   | Very strong results. Random Forest is robust to noise and overfitting due to averaging over many trees. Especially good with medium-sized datasets and non-linear relationships.                                                      |\n",

    "#### Overfitting Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the model achieving high performance on the training data (Train AUC \\~0.989–0.990), the validation AUC remained very close (0.980–0.981). The gap between training and validation performance was approximately 0.008–0.009 across all folds. This small and consistent difference indicates that the model is not overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional evidence against overfitting includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A balanced confusion matrix showing low false positives and false negatives\n",
    "* Smooth ROC curves on unseen validation data\n",
    "* The final LightGBM model’s ability to generalize across different splits of the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "To further reduce the risk of overfitting, we implemented several safeguards:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Early stopping** set to 30 rounds to prevent overtraining\n",
    "* **Subsampling and column sampling**: `subsample=0.8`, `colsample_bytree=0.9`\n",
    "* **Feature reduction**: the feature set was narrowed to \\~180 from over 200 after preprocessing and cleaning\n",
    "* **No test leakage**: the test set was never used in training or parameter tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the combination of consistent validation performance, robust regularization, and validation-set evaluation confirms that the model is not overfitting and generalizes well to new data.\n"

    "\n",
    "After selecting the best-performing model (LightGBM with optimized hyperparameters), we performed final predictions on the **test set** provided in `test.csv`. The model outputs **probabilistic predictions**, which were saved in the required submission format as `results_31.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key implementation details:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The pipeline includes **data loading**, **preprocessing**, **feature engineering**, and **model inference**.\n",
    "* The trained model was applied on **all test observations**, without leakage from training.\n",
    "* Results were saved as a `.csv` file with two columns:\n",
    "  `Id` and `Prediction` (probability score between 0 and 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "We also ensured the pipeline is **reproducible** and organized as a single block of code that allows quick re-execution from raw data to final output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance Note:\n",
    "The final AUC score on validation data was **0.9809**, significantly exceeding the minimum requirement of **0.70**, indicating a robust and reliable model.\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 6 – Use of External Tool Beyond Course Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "We used **LightGBM** (`LGBMClassifier`) — a powerful gradient boosting framework that was not covered in the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Why we used it**: It’s fast, scalable, and well-suited for large tabular datasets like ours.\n",
    "* **How it works**: It builds trees leaf-wise using histogram-based splits and supports early stopping, missing values, and regularization.\n",
    "* **Impact**: LightGBM gave us top AUC performance and faster training.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we implemented a **logging and saving mechanism** not taught in class:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each model run was logged automatically (AUC, parameters, timestamp, etc.) to a `.csv` file.\n",
    "* We also saved the best models using `joblib`, which allowed for reproducibility and future reuse (even though we didn’t reload them in the final notebook).\n",
    "* And all the other tools and techniques described in Part 2, where we built an environment that allowed us to test many different models, configurations, and even datasets. The system was fully automated and could run on its own without anyone needing to monitor it. \n",
    "\n",
    "This made our experimentation cleaner and more manageable.\n"
